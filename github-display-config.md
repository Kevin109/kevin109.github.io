# TFT Display Configuration Files for Embedded SBCs

This page provides pre-tested Device Tree Source (DTS) configurations for integrating TFT LCD display modules with popular Rockchip-based Single Board Computers (SBCs), including RK3576, RK3566, RK3568, PX30, A33, and others. It aims to help embedded Linux and Android developers quickly bring up display interfaces in custom or commercial projects.

## ✨ Key Features

* 📌 Ready-to-use `.dts` and `.dtsi` configuration files
* 🧩 Supports TFT LCD modules like RK050HR18, RK070CU01
* 🛠️ Compatible with Android and Linux kernel (4.19/5.10/5.15)
* ✅ Validated on PX30, RK3566 SBC platforms
* 🔧 Easily adaptable to custom SBC designs

## 📖 Why DTS Matters for Rockchip-Based SBCs

In embedded Linux systems, the Device Tree (DT) is a hardware description mechanism used by the Linux kernel. It tells the kernel what devices exist, how they’re connected, and how they should be initialized. For TFT displays, accurate DTS configurations are crucial to ensure proper panel initialization, power sequencing, timing synchronization, and backlight control.

## 🧠 Anatomy of a Panel Node

Each TFT panel has unique specifications such as resolution, interface (RGB, LVDS, MIPI), timing parameters, and reset behavior. A typical Device Tree snippet for a panel might look like:

```dts
panel: panel {
    compatible = "rocktech,rk070cu01";
    backlight = <&backlight>;
    power-supply = <&vcc_3v3>;
    enable-gpios = <&gpio3 15 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
    ...
};
```

Understanding these parameters helps customize the display for a specific board layout or power scheme.

## 📚 Use Case: Rapid Prototyping Workflow

When developing a new product using a Rockchip SoC and a selected Rocktech TFT display, our typical steps include:

1. Selecting a compatible panel (e.g., RK070CU01)
2. Creating a fly-wire breakout board if needed
3. Applying DTS config to enable basic display functionality
4. Verifying resolution and interface settings on Linux/Android console
5. Refining backlight, brightness, and touch panel integration if needed

## 🧪 Example: RK070CU01 DTS Configuration

The RK070CU01 7-inch LVDS display is widely used in industrial and HMI devices. A sample DTS configuration includes:

```dts
&lvds {
    status = "okay";
    rockchip,data-mapping = "vesa-24";
    rockchip,output = "dual";
};

panel {
    compatible = "rocktech,rk070cu01";
    ...
};
```

You’ll need to ensure correct timing parameters (hsync, vsync, pixel-clock) based on the panel datasheet.

## 🛠️ Common Issues & Troubleshooting

| Problem                 | Solution                                                 |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blank screen after boot | Check power-on delay, enable GPIO, and backlight control |
| Incorrect resolution    | Validate timing parameters in panel node                 |
| Kernel crash            | DTS syntax or wrong phandle reference                    |

Always use `dmesg`, `cat /proc/device-tree` and oscilloscope for debugging.
