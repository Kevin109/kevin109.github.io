## 🧩 Device Tree Configuration

To use this panel on a Linux or Android system:

- Enable the RGB output interface in DTS  
- Set panel timing according to RK050HR18 datasheet  
- Define backlight GPIO and PWM for brightness  
- Use `display-timings` node with accurate polarity flags

This display requires proper drive strength and signal routing due to RGB's parallel nature.
